# Video_OpenVibe
My code to display video with OpenVibe with the OpenCV library 

Before you can use it you need to download : 
- Python 3.7.8 (only version of python that is allowed by OpenVibe)
- OpenCV 4.5.1

You also need to change the directory of the file in:

- OpenVibe on the box "stimulus generator"
- Openvive on the box "display stimulus"
- On Protocole.py line 81
